# Profile-page

I've created a web page that best shows profile in basic HTML and CSS.

The web page includes the following elements:

● a navigation bar using flexbox. Each item takes you to a corresponding topic of the profile page (Items are About Me, Education, Contact Me)

● a title

● one paragraph

● one list (ordered or unordered) with at least three list items

● one hyperlink to another web page

● an image that has a thumbnail

● one table (for showing  educational details)

● a footer with contact details ( email id, phone no, linkedin, github etc)
